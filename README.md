# Hangman
Web hangman that changes what word it has in mind according to what letters you enter to make the game either easier or harder.

HtmlPage*.html are various versions of the frontend, do*.py are various versions of the backend. Whether the word is changed to make the game harder or easier is up to the backend. I think do.py makes it harder and the others make it easier.
